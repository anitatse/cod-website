    <h1>Our Classes</h1>
    <p>
      Our faculty have trained, performed and taught dance at the highest levels in China, and use the same rigorous teaching methods to train students in dance. As Chinese dance is a highly adaptable dance genre, our classes are suitable for all ages and skill levels, and we have welcomed students as young as 3 to any age above that. We strive to individually develop and maximize each student’s potential through the integration of modern teaching methods and professional standards.
      <br></br>
Colors of Dance Academy has courses based on Beijing Dance Academy Chinese Dance Syllabus (Grade 1 - 13; ages 4 - 18); Chinese Classical Dance and Rhythm Training, Chinese Minority Dances, Children’s Ballet, Repertoire and private classes, Adult Dance classes, Fitness Dance, etc.
    </p>
    <h2>Youth Classes</h2>
    <p>
      Youth Classes provide dance training and education to students from age three and above. Students receive basic training to improve their strength, flexibility, coordination, posture, rhythm, and expression. Each year students focus on one new dance style, from one of the many Chinese minority and classical dances. We challenge our students to achieve their best, in a fun and motivating environment.

        <h4>Examinable Graded Classes </h4>
        <p>
          Our graded classes are built to help students continually learn and develop their Chinese dance skills with each year. Dancers are placed in classes according to their age range and will learn according to the Beijing Dance Academy examinable syllabus, with the option to take the examination at the end of the year. Students who complete the grade 7, 8, or 9 examination are eligible for external credentials under the BC high school education system.
        </p>
        <h4>Youth Elites</h4>
        <p>
          Our youth elite class is for intermediate level dancers or students who have completed the graded curriculum, and are interested in expanding their performance opportunities. Students here can learn with like-aged peers and at a pace suited to them.
        </p>
        <h4>Performers</h4>
        <p>
          The performers troupe is the most advanced class at the academy, where all students come with previous dance experience and are able to commit to the class’s many performances. The class focusses on enhancing technical and artistic excellence through combinations and an extended repertoire of two or more dances per academic year. The Performers troupe can be found performing at many functions and competitions both locally and worldwide.

        <h2>Adult Classes</h2>
        <p>
          Adult classes are dedicated to mature dancers of all skill levels who want to pursue their interest in Chinese dance. The Academy offers two types of classes: The repertoire class draws on the same teaching theories and practices used in the Youth Classes where dancers spend the year working towards a repertoire piece to be performed at the Colours of Dance annual showcase and other local performances. The Technique class for dancers who want to improve their fitness and Chinese dance technique without the pressure of preparing for performances, and is geared towards adults with busy schedules.
        </p>
        <h2>Private/Semi-Private Classes</h2>
        <p>
          We offer private and semi-private classes to students who wish to receive individual attention and progress at their own pace, or if they are unable to attend an appropriate group classes for various reasons. Private classes are also offered for students who want to challenge themselves by learning specialized dance routines such as solos, duos, and trios.

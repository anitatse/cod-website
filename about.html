Students in the Colours of Dance Academy are locally trained with the same strict standard used in China and our Academy also provide extensive training for students who would like to seek careers in the Faculty of Dance. Outstanding students would also have opportunity to study dance in China. Morever, students are encouraged to push beyond technical skills, as dance is pivotal to developing teamwork and community bonds. To gain confidence on the stage and outside of the studio, students are given opportunities to showcase their skills at performances both locally and around the world.
